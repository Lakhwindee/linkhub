## ‚ùå BROKEN/DISABLED FEATURES

### 1. Subscribe Page Authentication Bug
**Issue:** `/subscribe` page redirects to `/api/login` even though it's listed as a public route

**Location:** `client/src/pages/Subscribe.tsx` lines 64-75

**Root Cause:** Hard-coded authentication check with redirect:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isLoading && !isAuthenticated) {
    toast({
      title: "Unauthorized",
      description: "You are logged out. Logging in again...",
      variant: "destructive",
    });
    setTimeout(() => {
      window.location.href = "/api/login";
    }, 500);
    return;
  }
}, [isLoading, isAuthenticated]);
```

**Expected Behavior:** Subscribe page should be accessible to both:
- Unauthenticated users (to see plans and sign up)
- Authenticated users (to upgrade/change plans)

**Fix Required:** Remove or conditionally apply the authentication redirect

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES & WARNINGS

### 1. WebSocket Handshake Failures
**Console Warning:**
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://127.0.0.1:5000/?token=...' failed: 
Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 400
```

**Impact:** Minor - Vite HMR (Hot Module Reload) warning only  
**Status:** Does not affect functionality  
**Action:** Can be safely ignored in development

### 2. Stripe HTTPS Warning
**Console Warning:**
```
You may test your Stripe.js integration over HTTP. 
However, live Stripe.js integrations must use HTTPS.
```

**Impact:** Development only  
**Status:** Expected in local development  
**Action:** Production deployment will use HTTPS automatically

### 3. Password Field Warning
**Console Warning:**
```
[DOM] Password field is not contained in a form
```

**Location:** Admin login page (`/admin`)  
**Impact:** Minor accessibility/browser autofill issue  
**Status:** Cosmetic warning  
**Action:** Non-critical, can be improved later
