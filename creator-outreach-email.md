Dear [Creator Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I'm reaching out from HubLink, a new global travel community platform launching this year.

We've been following your travel content on YouTube, and we're genuinely impressed by the authentic experiences you share and the engaged community you've built around your channel. Your storytelling and travel expertise are exactly what we're looking for in our founding creator community.

**Why We're Reaching Out**

HubLink is launching an exclusive Creator Partnership Program, and we would be honored to have you join as one of our founding creators. We're offering you a 2-month complimentary Premium membership (valued at £90) along with exclusive ongoing benefits as our way of inviting you to explore the platform.

**What is HubLink?**

HubLink is an all-in-one platform designed specifically for the travel community. We've built a space where travelers and creators can share experiences, connect with followers, plan events, discover travel services, and most importantly, monetize their content through brand partnerships.

The platform combines social networking with practical travel tools and monetization opportunities - all in one unified experience.

**Core Platform Features**

*Social Community*
Share your travel stories through posts, photos, and videos with a global audience. Build your follower base, engage through direct messaging, and showcase your journey with a customizable profile. Premium creators receive verified badges and priority visibility in the community.

*Brand Partnerships & Monetization*
Access our marketplace of travel brand advertising campaigns. Browse available partnerships, submit your content, and receive payment directly through our secure payment system. Campaign fees range from £50 to £5,000 depending on scope and requirements. All payments are processed automatically with full tax compliance handled on your behalf.

*Event Planning*
Create and host travel meetups, group tours, workshops, or dining experiences. Connect with your followers in person and discover events from other creators worldwide.

*Travel Services*
Explore and book accommodations, tour packages, and connect with local hosts. Our platform includes verified listings with secure booking and payment processing.

*Analytics & Insights*
Track your audience growth, engagement metrics, campaign performance, and earnings through a comprehensive dashboard designed specifically for creators.

After your complimentary period, you'll have the option to continue with Premium at £45/month, or we can provide you with an exclusive discount code offering 20% off (£36/month) as a founding creator benefit.

**What We're Looking For**

We'd love for you to join HubLink, explore the platform, and share your travel experiences with our growing community. If you enjoy the platform and find value in it, we'd appreciate you mentioning it to your audience authentically, but there's absolutely no requirement to do so.
